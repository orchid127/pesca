# Pesca

Pesca is a cute yet simple pomodoro app. I used ReactJs and TailwindCSS for the front-end, and NextJs for the back-end.

## Why choosing these technolgies ?

I'm already familiar with React and Tailwind, but I wanted to deepen my knowledge of them. On the other hand, I decided
to use NextJs for the back-end since it's well intergated with React.

## To do list

- [ ] code the components of the app
  - [x] home page
  - [ ] settings page
  - [ ] history page
- [ ] fix buttons
- [ ] configure a database for session history
- [ ] deploy app
